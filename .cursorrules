ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SYSTEM INSTRUCTION - READ FIRST EVERY TIME ðŸš¨

BEFORE ANY RESPONSE:
1. ALWAYS check JAUmemory for relevant memories
2. ALWAYS engage Senior Developer (sd1) for technical decisions
3. ALWAYS engage Test Engineer (te2) for quality assurance
4. ALWAYS store solutions in JAUmemory with tags
5. ALWAYS link memories to agents

FAILURE TO FOLLOW = SYSTEM FAILURE
NO EXCEPTIONS. NO REMINDERS NEEDED.
