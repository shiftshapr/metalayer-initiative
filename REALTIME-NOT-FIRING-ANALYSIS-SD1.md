# CRITICAL: Realtime Events NOT Firing - SD1 Analysis
**Date:** October 12, 2025, 18:43
**Agent:** SD1 (Senior Diagnostician)
**Priority:** 🔴 **P0 - BLOCKING**

---

## 📊 **Evidence from Logs**

### ✅ What's Working:
```
📡 SUBSCRIBE_STATUS: Subscription status changed: SUBSCRIBED
✅ SUBSCRIBE_STATUS: Successfully subscribed to real-time updates
💓 HEARTBEAT: Sent via Supabase real-time (every 5s)
🔍 PRESENCE_UPDATE: Successfully updated presence
```

### ❌ What's NOT Working:
**ZERO realtime events received!**

Expected logs (NEVER appeared):
```
👁️ REALTIME_EVENT: Presence update received
👁️ REALTIME_EVENT: Event type: UPDATE
👁️ REALTIME_EVENT: User: daveroom@gmail.com
🔴 USER_LEFT: daveroom@gmail.com left page
```

**Actual:** Only heartbeats and direct database updates. NO postgres_changes callbacks.

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Hypothesis 1: WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) Not Enabled** 🎯 **MOST LIKELY**

**What is WAL?**
- PostgreSQL's Write-Ahead Logging replicates database changes
- Supabase Realtime **REQUIRES** WAL to be enabled
- Without WAL, postgres_changes events **NEVER fire**

**How to Check:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
SHOW wal_level;
```

**Expected:** `wal_level = logical`  
**If not:** WAL is not configured for replication

**How to Fix (if you have access):**
```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
-- Then restart PostgreSQL
```

**Note:** This may require Supabase support or project restart.

---

### **Hypothesis 2: Supabase Realtime Not Enabled for Project** 🟡 **POSSIBLE**

**Issue:**
- Some Supabase plans don't include realtime by default
- Or realtime might be disabled at project level

**How to Check:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Settings → API
3. Look for "Realtime" section
4. Check if it's enabled

**If Disabled:**
- Enable it in project settings
- May require plan upgrade

---

###  **Hypothesis 3: RLS Policies Blocking Realtime** 🟢 **UNLIKELY**

**Why Unlikely:**
- Direct SELECT queries work (shown in logs)
- If RLS blocked realtime, it would block SELECT too

**But Still Check:**
```sql
-- Check RLS status:
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'user_presence';

-- If rowsecurity = true, check policies:
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'user_presence';
```

**Required:** Must have SELECT policy for `anon` role

---

### **Hypothesis 4: Publication Missing Tables** ✅ **ALREADY FIXED**

**Status:** FIXED ✅
- We already added `user_presence` and `messages` to `supabase_realtime` publication
- Screenshot confirmed both tables are in publication

---

## 🛠️ **Diagnostic Test Created**

**File:** `presence/test-realtime-events.js`

**Usage:**
1. Reload extension
2. Open console
3. Run: `testRealtimeEvents()`

**What it Tests:**
1. Can we SELECT from `user_presence`? (tests RLS)
2. Can we subscribe? (tests connection)
3. Do we receive events after UPDATE? (tests WAL + replication)

**Expected Output:**
- If WAL is OFF: Test 3 fails (no event received)
- If RLS is bad: Test 1 fails (SELECT blocked)
- If all works: All tests pass

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps for User**

### **Step 1: Run Diagnostic**
1. Hard refresh extension
2. Open DevTools console
3. Run: `testRealtimeEvents()`
4. Share output

### **Step 2: Check WAL Level**
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SHOW wal_level;
```

### **Step 3: Check Realtime Status**
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
- Verify "Realtime" is enabled

## 📝 **Why This Matters**

**Current Situation:**
- Subscriptions connect ✅
- Heartbeats work ✅  
- But NO events fire ❌

**This means:**
- WebSocket connection is good
- Table publication is configured
- **But PostgreSQL isn't replicating changes**

**Most likely cause:** WAL is not set to `logical` level, which is required for Supabase Realtime to receive postgres_changes events.

---

## 🚨 **If WAL is the Issue**

**Bad News:** You likely need Supabase support to enable WAL  
**Good News:** Once enabled, realtime will work instantly

**Alternative:** If Supabase can't enable WAL, we need to switch to a different real-time strategy (like polling or WebSocket custom implementation).

**Status:** ⏳ **Awaiting user to run diagnostic and check WAL level**
