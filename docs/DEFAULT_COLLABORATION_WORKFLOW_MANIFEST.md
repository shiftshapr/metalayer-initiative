# Default Collaboration Workflow Manifest

## Overview
This manifest defines the standard agent collaboration workflow for all orchestrated tasks. All agents must follow this workflow and enforce blind-spot and red-line audits.

## Workflow Guardrails

1. **TypeScript ES Modules**: All new/updated code must use ES6 module syntax with TypeScript (no CommonJS, no implicit globals).
2. **Modular Architecture**: Prefer small, composable modules over monolithic files; refactors should extract shared utilities instead of duplicating logic.
3. **No Pre-Launch Backward Compatibility Paths**: Remove legacy fallbacks/duplicated fields during implementation. Exceptions require PM + BLUE sign-off and must be logged in JAUmemory.
4. **Duplication Checks**: Before writing new utilities/components, search for existing equivalents and extend them. Document the check in JAUmemory.
5. **Plan → Scaffold → Build**: Each task must capture planning notes, scaffolding artifacts, and the final build steps inside JAUmemory before coding progresses.
6. **Avoid Fallbacks**: Do not rely on `value || fallback` patterns that hide data issues. Fix the upstream source and document diagnostic evidence.
7. **Commit on Resolution**: After BLUE approval, produce a final commit referencing the JAUmemory problem ID and summarize verification steps.
8. **Unify Repeated Logic**: Look for opportunities to extract shared helpers/modules whenever similar code appears; log the reuse decision in JAUmemory.
9. **JAUmemory Logging**: Every phase update (problem, diagnostics, solution, verification, blind-spots, red-line status) must be logged with context, files, and owners.

## Parallel Orchestration Protocol

For time-consuming yet partitionable tasks (e.g., medium refactors, cleanup passes, diagnostic conversions):
- PM must evaluate whether work can be distributed. If yes, **ask the user to spin up 8–10 parallel Orch sessions**.
- Provide each Orch with:
  - Unique sub-objectives/files
  - Estimated runtime parity
  - Links to the shared JAUmemory problem + diagnostics
- BLUE must confirm that coordination overhead is addressed (shared standups, integration plan) before approving completion.

## Problem Tracking and Memory Management

All agents must follow this knowledge management process to ensure problems are tracked, solutions are documented, and knowledge is preserved across sessions.

### Problem Identification Phase
When a problem is identified:
1. **Check JAUmemory** for existing records of the same or similar problems
   - Search using relevant keywords, tags, and context
   - Review related memories for patterns or recurring issues
   
2. **If problem not found**, create a new memory with:
   - **Content**: Clear problem description
   - **Context**: Project name, component, affected systems
   - **Tags**: Categorization tags (e.g., "bug", "frontend", "database", "api")
   - **Importance**: Severity score (0.0-1.0)
   - **Metadata**: 
     - Status: "identified"
     - Root cause analysis (if known)
     - Impact assessment
     - Related components/files

### Solution Proposal Phase
When proposing solutions:
1. **Update the memory** with:
   - **Content**: Updated with proposed solution(s)
   - **Metadata**:
     - Status: "proposed"
     - Proposed solution(s) description
     - Implementation plan
     - Risk assessment
     - Dependencies
     - Estimated effort

2. **Link related memories** if the problem relates to other issues

### Solution Implementation Phase
During implementation:
1. **Update the memory** with:
   - **Content**: Updated with implementation details
   - **Metadata**:
     - Status: "implemented"
     - Code changes made
     - Files modified
     - Testing approach
     - Implementation notes

### Verification Phase
After implementation:
1. **Update the memory** with:
   - **Content**: Updated with verification results
   - **Metadata**:
     - Status: "solved" or "failed"
     - Verification results
     - Test outcomes
     - Confirmation of fix
     - Lessons learned
     - Related memories/agents

2. **Link to related memories** for better knowledge graph

### Knowledge Consolidation
Periodically (at end of tasks or weekly):
1. **Consolidate similar problems** into insights
   - Use `consolidate_collection()` to group related memories
   - Create summary insights from patterns
   - Archive original memories if consolidated

2. **Update agent memories** with lessons learned
   - Link solved problems to relevant agents
   - Update agent knowledge base
   - Share insights across agents

### Memory Management Best Practices
- **Always check first**: Before creating new memories, search for existing ones
- **Be specific**: Include enough context for future recall
- **Use tags**: Consistent tagging improves searchability
- **Link related**: Connect related problems and solutions
- **Update status**: Keep memory status current throughout the workflow
- **Consolidate regularly**: Group similar issues to identify patterns

### Integration with Agent Workflow
- **PM**: Responsible for initial problem identification and memory creation
- **SD**: Updates memory with proposed solutions
- **TEST**: Updates memory with test results
- **All Agents**: Update memory when identifying new problems or solutions
- **BLUE**: Finalizes memory status and triggers consolidation

## Diagnostic Script Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All problems being worked on MUST have diagnostic scripts created to identify root causes, regardless of whether a solution is being provided (except when a script is not useful, e.g., time-sensitive issues).

### Diagnostic Script Framework
A comprehensive diagnostic framework is available at `/presence/utils/ROOT_CAUSE_DIAGNOSTIC_FRAMEWORK.js` that provides:
- Standardized diagnostic structure
- Multiple diagnostic types (data persistence, CSS, network, state)
- Automatic result collection and reporting
- Easy registration of new diagnostics

### When to Create Diagnostic Scripts
1. **Always**: When working on any bug or issue
2. **Always**: Before implementing a solution (to understand root cause)
3. **Always**: After implementing a solution (to verify the fix)
4. **Exception**: When a script is not useful (e.g., time-sensitive issues, user-reported visual issues that require manual inspection)

### Diagnostic Script Requirements

#### For Data Persistence Issues
- Check all data sources (Chrome storage, UserPreferencesManager, window.currentUser, database)
- Verify consistency across sources
- Test save operations and verify persistence
- Log all values from each source
- Identify where data is missing or inconsistent

#### For CSS/UI Issues
- Log computed CSS values for affected elements
- Check data attributes (e.g., `data-theme`)
- Verify element existence and visibility
- Log bounding rectangles and layout properties
- Check for CSS conflicts or overrides
- **Ask user to check**: Browser DevTools (Elements, Console, Network tabs)

#### For Network/API Issues
- Log all network requests (URL, duration, status, response)
- Check for failed requests
- Verify request/response payloads
- Check authentication headers
- Identify timing issues

#### For State Management Issues
- Log current state of relevant managers
- Check initialization status
- Verify queue sizes (batch, retry)
- Check online/offline status
- Log metrics and error counts

### Diagnostic Script Structure
```javascript
diagnosticFramework.register('issue-name', async () => {
  const results = {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    // Diagnostic checks here
  };
  
  // Perform checks
  // Log findings
  // Return structured results
  
  return results;
}, 'Description of what this diagnostic checks');
```

### Diagnostic Script Execution
- **Automatic**: Scripts can be registered to run automatically
- **Manual**: Call `diagnoseIssue('issue-name')` for specific diagnostics
- **Comprehensive**: Call `diagnoseAll()` to run all diagnostics
- **Results**: Access via `getDiagnosticResults()`

### User Interaction Requests
Diagnostic scripts should request user assistance when needed:
- **Visual inspection**: "Please check the interface - does [element] appear correctly?"
- **Console check**: "Please check the browser console for errors"
- **Network check**: "Please check the Network tab - are there any failed requests?"
- **Elements check**: "Please inspect [element] in DevTools - what are its computed styles?"

### Integration with Agent Workflow
- **PM**: Identifies need for diagnostic scripts during problem analysis
- **SD**: Creates diagnostic scripts as part of solution design
- **TEST**: Uses diagnostic scripts to verify fixes
- **All Agents**: Can request diagnostic scripts be created for their domain
- **BLUE**: Verifies diagnostic scripts were created and executed

### 8a. Post-Resolution Learning Phase (MANDATORY)
**Trigger**: After BLUE confirms fix is verified but BEFORE final approval
**Purpose**: Make the system better at getting better by learning from every resolved issue

**BLUE must execute these steps automatically (no user prompt required)**:

#### Step 1: Pattern Identification & Similar Issue Detection
1. **Search codebase for similar patterns**:
   - Use the solved problem's root cause, error signature, and code patterns
   - Search for similar code structures, error handling patterns, or data flows
   - Identify files/components with similar logic that might have the same issue

2. **Search JAUmemory for similar problems**:
   - Query: `recall({ query: "[root cause pattern]", limit: 20 })`
   - Look for similar error signatures, code patterns, or symptoms
   - Check if this is part of a recurring pattern

3. **Create or update pattern memory**:
   - If similar problems found: Link them together in a collection
   - Create pattern insight: "This type of issue occurs when [conditions]"
   - Document the pattern signature (error messages, code patterns, symptoms)

#### Step 2: Prevention Strategy
1. **Update guardrails if needed**:
   - If this bug type should be prevented by coding standards, propose `.cursorrules` update
   - Document the prevention pattern in JAUmemory
   - Link to the pattern memory

2. **Create prevention checklist**:
   - Add to agent memories: "When coding [feature type], always check [prevention pattern]"
   - Update relevant agent memories with prevention knowledge

3. **Update diagnostic patterns**:
   - If diagnostic script was created, register it as a reusable pattern
   - Document when to run this diagnostic (error signatures, symptoms)
   - Link diagnostic to the pattern memory

#### Step 3: Automatic Detection & Solution Surfacing
1. **Create pattern detection query**:
   - Document error signatures that trigger this pattern
   - Document code patterns that indicate this issue
   - Create searchable tags for automatic recall

2. **Register solution for automatic recall**:
   - When similar error appears, automatically surface this solution
   - Link solution to error signatures in JAUmemory
   - Create agent memory links so agents recall this pattern

3. **Update collections**:
   - Add to "Pattern Library" collection (create if doesn't exist)
   - Add to "Blind-Spot Patterns" collection if it's a blind-spot issue
   - Add to "Diagnostic Patterns" collection if diagnostic was created

#### Step 4: Knowledge Consolidation
1. **Consolidate related memories**:
   - If 2+ similar problems exist, use `consolidate_collection()` to create insight
   - Archive original memories if consolidated
   - Create summary: "Pattern: [name] - occurs when [conditions], fixed by [solution]"

2. **Update agent learning**:
   - Link pattern to relevant agents (SD, TEST, BLINDSPOT, etc.)
   - Create agent reflection: "We learned to [prevention action] when [conditions]"
   - Update agent memories with pattern recognition

**Output**: Learning Phase Report including:
- Similar issues found (in codebase and JAUmemory)
- Pattern created/updated
- Prevention strategies documented
- Diagnostic patterns registered
- Guardrail updates proposed (if any)
- Collections updated
- Agent memories updated

### 8b. META (Meta-Learning Agent) - Learning Process Oversight
**Role**: Oversees and improves the learning process itself
**Trigger**: 
- **Automatic**: After every learning phase (BLUE's post-resolution learning)
- **On-demand**: When learning seems ineffective or patterns aren't being captured
- **Periodic**: Weekly/monthly review of learning effectiveness

**Responsibilities**:
1. **Evaluate Learning Phase Effectiveness**:
   - Review the learning phase report from BLUE
   - Assess whether patterns were properly identified
   - Check if similar issues were found comprehensively
   - Verify that prevention strategies are actionable
   - Confirm diagnostic patterns are registered correctly

2. **Identify Learning Gaps**:
   - Find cases where similar issues exist but weren't detected
   - Identify patterns that should have been created but weren't
   - Spot prevention strategies that are missing
   - Notice when agent memories aren't being updated effectively

3. **Propose Learning System Improvements**:
   - Suggest enhancements to JAUmemory structure/organization
   - Propose better pattern detection queries
   - Recommend improvements to agent memory linking
   - Suggest new collections or consolidation strategies
   - Propose workflow changes to capture more learning

4. **Monitor Process for Learning Opportunities**:
   - Watch for recurring issues that should become patterns
   - Identify blind spots in the learning process itself
   - Notice when diagnostic scripts should be created but aren't
   - Spot opportunities to improve pattern matching

5. **Intervene When Learning is Ineffective**:
   - When patterns aren't being created: suggest better pattern identification
   - When similar issues aren't found: improve search queries
   - When prevention strategies are weak: propose stronger guardrails
   - When agent memories aren't updated: remind agents to link memories

6. **Create Meta-Learning Insights**:
   - Document what makes learning phases effective
   - Identify characteristics of good pattern memories
   - Track which prevention strategies work best
   - Learn from learning failures

**Output**: Meta-Learning Report including:
- Learning phase effectiveness assessment
- Learning gaps identified
- Proposed improvements to learning system
- Interventions made (if any)
- Meta-learning insights

**When to Invoke META**:
- **Automatic**: After every learning phase (built into workflow)
- **Manual**: "META, review the learning phase for problem [memoryId]"
- **On-demand**: "META, we keep missing similar issues - how can we improve pattern detection?"
- **Periodic**: "META, review our learning effectiveness over the past week"

### 9. DEVOPS (DevOps Engineer)
**Role**: Deployment and operations
**Responsibilities**:
- Deployment planning
- Infrastructure requirements
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Rollback procedures
- Performance considerations
- Operational runbooks

**Output**: Deployment Plan

### 10. ETHICS (Ethics Reviewer)
**Role**: Ethical considerations
**Responsibilities**:
- Privacy impact assessment
- User consent verification
- Data handling compliance
- Accessibility review
- Fairness and bias checks
- Ethical use verification

**Output**: Ethics Review Report

## Workflow Execution Order

```
PM → SD → TEST → RED → WHITE → PURPLE → BLINDSPOT → BLUE → [LEARN] → [META] → DEVOPS → ETHICS
```

**Note**: 
- The `[LEARN]` phase is automatically executed by BLUE as part of the final review process. It is not a separate agent but a mandatory learning phase that BLUE must complete before final approval.
- The `[META]` phase is automatically executed by META agent after the learning phase. META evaluates learning effectiveness and proposes improvements. META can also be invoked on-demand or periodically to review learning system effectiveness.
