# Default Collaboration Workflow Manifest

## Overview
This manifest defines the standard agent collaboration workflow for all orchestrated tasks. All agents must follow this workflow and enforce blind-spot and red-line audits.

## Problem Tracking and Memory Management

All agents must follow this knowledge management process to ensure problems are tracked, solutions are documented, and knowledge is preserved across sessions.

### Problem Identification Phase
When a problem is identified:
1. **Check JAUmemory** for existing records of the same or similar problems
   - Search using relevant keywords, tags, and context
   - Review related memories for patterns or recurring issues
   
2. **If problem not found**, create a new memory with:
   - **Content**: Clear problem description
   - **Context**: Project name, component, affected systems
   - **Tags**: Categorization tags (e.g., "bug", "frontend", "database", "api")
   - **Importance**: Severity score (0.0-1.0)
   - **Metadata**: 
     - Status: "identified"
     - Root cause analysis (if known)
     - Impact assessment
     - Related components/files

### Solution Proposal Phase
When proposing solutions:
1. **Update the memory** with:
   - **Content**: Updated with proposed solution(s)
   - **Metadata**:
     - Status: "proposed"
     - Proposed solution(s) description
     - Implementation plan
     - Risk assessment
     - Dependencies
     - Estimated effort

2. **Link related memories** if the problem relates to other issues

### Solution Implementation Phase
During implementation:
1. **Update the memory** with:
   - **Content**: Updated with implementation details
   - **Metadata**:
     - Status: "implemented"
     - Code changes made
     - Files modified
     - Testing approach
     - Implementation notes

### Verification Phase
After implementation:
1. **Update the memory** with:
   - **Content**: Updated with verification results
   - **Metadata**:
     - Status: "solved" or "failed"
     - Verification results
     - Test outcomes
     - Confirmation of fix
     - Lessons learned
     - Related memories/agents

2. **Link to related memories** for better knowledge graph

### Knowledge Consolidation
Periodically (at end of tasks or weekly):
1. **Consolidate similar problems** into insights
   - Use `consolidate_collection()` to group related memories
   - Create summary insights from patterns
   - Archive original memories if consolidated

2. **Update agent memories** with lessons learned
   - Link solved problems to relevant agents
   - Update agent knowledge base
   - Share insights across agents

### Memory Management Best Practices
- **Always check first**: Before creating new memories, search for existing ones
- **Be specific**: Include enough context for future recall
- **Use tags**: Consistent tagging improves searchability
- **Link related**: Connect related problems and solutions
- **Update status**: Keep memory status current throughout the workflow
- **Consolidate regularly**: Group similar issues to identify patterns

### Integration with Agent Workflow
- **PM**: Responsible for initial problem identification and memory creation
- **SD**: Updates memory with proposed solutions
- **TEST**: Updates memory with test results
- **All Agents**: Update memory when identifying new problems or solutions
- **BLUE**: Finalizes memory status and triggers consolidation

## Diagnostic Script Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All problems being worked on MUST have diagnostic scripts created to identify root causes, regardless of whether a solution is being provided (except when a script is not useful, e.g., time-sensitive issues).

### Diagnostic Script Framework
A comprehensive diagnostic framework is available at `/presence/utils/ROOT_CAUSE_DIAGNOSTIC_FRAMEWORK.js` that provides:
- Standardized diagnostic structure
- Multiple diagnostic types (data persistence, CSS, network, state)
- Automatic result collection and reporting
- Easy registration of new diagnostics

### When to Create Diagnostic Scripts
1. **Always**: When working on any bug or issue
2. **Always**: Before implementing a solution (to understand root cause)
3. **Always**: After implementing a solution (to verify the fix)
4. **Exception**: When a script is not useful (e.g., time-sensitive issues, user-reported visual issues that require manual inspection)

### Diagnostic Script Requirements

#### For Data Persistence Issues
- Check all data sources (Chrome storage, UserPreferencesManager, window.currentUser, database)
- Verify consistency across sources
- Test save operations and verify persistence
- Log all values from each source
- Identify where data is missing or inconsistent

#### For CSS/UI Issues
- Log computed CSS values for affected elements
- Check data attributes (e.g., `data-theme`)
- Verify element existence and visibility
- Log bounding rectangles and layout properties
- Check for CSS conflicts or overrides
- **Ask user to check**: Browser DevTools (Elements, Console, Network tabs)

#### For Network/API Issues
- Log all network requests (URL, duration, status, response)
- Check for failed requests
- Verify request/response payloads
- Check authentication headers
- Identify timing issues

#### For State Management Issues
- Log current state of relevant managers
- Check initialization status
- Verify queue sizes (batch, retry)
- Check online/offline status
- Log metrics and error counts

### Diagnostic Script Structure
```javascript
diagnosticFramework.register('issue-name', async () => {
  const results = {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    // Diagnostic checks here
  };
  
  // Perform checks
  // Log findings
  // Return structured results
  
  return results;
}, 'Description of what this diagnostic checks');
```

### Diagnostic Script Execution
- **Automatic**: Scripts can be registered to run automatically
- **Manual**: Call `diagnoseIssue('issue-name')` for specific diagnostics
- **Comprehensive**: Call `diagnoseAll()` to run all diagnostics
- **Results**: Access via `getDiagnosticResults()`

### User Interaction Requests
Diagnostic scripts should request user assistance when needed:
- **Visual inspection**: "Please check the interface - does [element] appear correctly?"
- **Console check**: "Please check the browser console for errors"
- **Network check**: "Please check the Network tab - are there any failed requests?"
- **Elements check**: "Please inspect [element] in DevTools - what are its computed styles?"

### Integration with Agent Workflow
- **PM**: Identifies need for diagnostic scripts during problem analysis
- **SD**: Creates diagnostic scripts as part of solution design
- **TEST**: Uses diagnostic scripts to verify fixes
- **All Agents**: Can request diagnostic scripts be created for their domain
